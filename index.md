## About Me

I am a master’s student at Leiden University studying Linguistics (Language and Communication). I am particularly interested in Neo-Gricean pragmatics, scalar implicatures and lexical semantics. I am currently working on my Master thesis in which I am investigating the generation of generalized conversational implicatures associated with the use of the indefinite article. I have also started exploring computational linguistics and how it ties to my current research interests.
<br>
In Winter 2021, I completed a Bootcamp in Data Science at Le Wagon, Berlin to enhance my computational data modeling skillset.
<br>
Since March 2022, I work as a Speech Expert at Cerence Inc., where I work on the speech prompt optimization of TTS output.
<br>
I am also interested in learning languages. I am fluent in French, German, English and during my undergraduate I spent time abroad in Japan and South Korea to further improve my language skills.
