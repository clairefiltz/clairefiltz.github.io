## About Me

I am a Masters student at Leiden University studying Linguistics (Language and Communication). I am particularly interested in Neo-Gricean pragmatics, scalar implicatures and lexical semantics. I am currently working on my Master thesis in which I am investigating the generation of generalized conversational implicatures associated with the use of the indefinite article.

Lately I have started exploring computational linguistics and how it ties to my current research interests.

I am also interested in learning languages. I am fluent in French, German, English and during my undergraduate 
I spent time abroad in Japan and South Korea to further improve my language skills.
